			<p> The front door boasts two lizard men and a tile trap that will likely deal about half of your health if all three hit. This trap can be used to kill or wound the snakemen as they will run in the line of fire in order to get to you if you aggro them and then run out the front door (missing the tile) then you can turn around and hit the trap whenever the serpent men are standing in front of the trap </p>
		<h1> The Rest of It </h1>
			<p> This is a work in progress and the rest of the fortress should be made navigable by the <a href="http://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Sen%27s+Fortress"> wiki page </a>
